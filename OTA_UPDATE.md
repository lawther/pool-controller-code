# OTA (Over-The-Air) Firmware Updates

This document describes the OTA firmware update features.

## Overview

The device supports updating firmware over WiFi without needing a USB connection. The OTA update system uses dual app partitions for safe rollback if the new firmware fails to boot.

There are three ways to update:

1. **Update from GitHub (recommended)** — the device checks the project's GitHub *latest release* on a schedule, and can download and install it on demand. No file handling required.
2. **Home Assistant update entity** — the "Firmware" update entity mirrors the GitHub check and installs with the HA *Install* button.
3. **Manual upload** — upload a locally built `.bin` from the `/update` page.

## Update from GitHub

### How it works

- On boot (after a short delay) and every `FW_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` (default 12 h), the firmware resolves `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest`. The request is issued with auto-redirect disabled, and the latest tag is read from the `Location: .../releases/tag/<tag>` header — no GitHub API token and no rate-limited JSON call.
- The tag is compared against the running build's version (`major.minor.patch`, ignoring any `git describe` suffix). If it is newer, an update is flagged as available.
- Installing pulls the release asset `pool-controller-update-<tag>.bin` (the artifact the build workflow uploads) directly over HTTPS via `esp_https_ota`, writing to the inactive OTA partition, then reboots.

The GitHub owner/repo, asset name prefix, check interval, and timeouts are configured in `main/config.h` (`FW_UPDATE_*`).

### From the web UI

1. Open `http://<device-ip>/update`.
2. The **Update from GitHub** section shows whether you are up to date or a newer release is available (with a link to the release notes).
3. Click **Check for updates** to re-check immediately, or **Install update** to download and install the latest release. Progress is shown; the device reboots when finished.

### From Home Assistant

With MQTT configured, the device publishes a Home Assistant `update` entity ("Firmware") via MQTT discovery. It shows the installed and latest versions and provides an **Install** button that triggers the same GitHub OTA. Download progress is reported back to the entity.

### Network requirements

The device must be able to reach `github.com` and `objects.githubusercontent.com` (where release downloads redirect) over HTTPS. TLS is validated against the ESP-IDF certificate bundle (`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE`).

## Partition Layout

The device uses the following partition table (defined in `partitions.csv`):

- **nvs** (0x6000 / 24KB) - Non-volatile storage for WiFi credentials, settings
- **phy_init** (0x1000 / 4KB) - PHY initialization data
- **otadata** (0x2000 / 8KB) - OTA data partition (tracks which OTA partition to boot)
- **factory** (0x180000 / 1.5MB) - Initial firmware partition
- **ota_0** (0x180000 / 1.5MB) - First OTA update partition
- **ota_1** (0x180000 / 1.5MB) - Second OTA update partition

Updates alternate between ota_0 and ota_1, providing automatic rollback protection. The **otadata** partition is critical - it stores which OTA partition should boot next.

## Manual Upload (build and upload a .bin)

Use this when developing locally or installing a build that isn't a published GitHub release.

### 1. Build New Firmware

```bash
idf.py build
```

The firmware binary will be at: `build/pool-controller.bin`

### 2. Access Update Page

1. Connect to the device's WiFi network or ensure you're on the same network
2. Navigate to: `http://<device-ip>/update`
3. The page shows:
   - Current firmware version
   - Partition that will be written
   - File upload form

### 3. Upload Firmware

1. Click "Select Firmware File (.bin)"
2. Choose the `pool-controller.bin` file from the build directory
3. Click "Upload and Update"
4. **DO NOT power off the device during update!**

### 4. Monitor Progress

- Upload progress bar shows transfer status
- Success message appears when update completes
- Device automatically restarts with new firmware

## Safety Features

### Automatic Rollback

If the new firmware fails to boot (crashes, bootloops, etc.), the ESP32 automatically reverts to the previous working firmware after 3 failed boot attempts.

### Boot Confirmation

The new firmware must call `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()` within the first few boots to confirm it's working. This is handled automatically in `main.c`.

### Validation

- Firmware image is validated before writing (checksums, format verification)
- Invalid images are rejected before any changes are made
- Partition integrity is verified after writing

## Troubleshooting

### "No OTA partition configured" Error

Ensure `partitions.csv` is properly configured in the build system. Check that menuconfig uses the custom partition table:
```bash
idf.py menuconfig
# Navigate to: Partition Table -> Partition Table -> Custom partition table CSV
# Set: partitions.csv
```

### Update Fails Midway

- Check WiFi signal strength (update can fail on poor connection)
- Ensure the .bin file is not corrupted (re-build if necessary)
- Verify sufficient free space on update partition

### Device Won't Boot After Update

The device should automatically rollback. If it doesn't:
1. Connect via USB serial
2. Check logs with `idf.py monitor`
3. Manually flash factory firmware if needed: `idf.py flash`

### Version Shows as "dirty"

Commit your Git changes before building:
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"
idf.py build
```

The version is generated from Git tags using `git describe`.

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

- Web upload requires network access to device
- No authentication on /update endpoint (rely on network security)
- No firmware signature verification

### Recommended Improvements for Production

1. **Add authentication** - Require password before allowing upload
2. **Use HTTPS** - Encrypt firmware transfer
3. **Enable signature verification** - ESP-IDF supports signed OTA images
4. **Rate limiting** - Prevent brute force attempts

Example of enabling signature verification in menuconfig:
```
Security Features -> Enable hardware Secure Boot in bootloader
```

## Version Information

The current firmware version is displayed:
- On the `/update` page
- In the `/status` API endpoint
- In boot logs via serial monitor

Version format: `v{tag}-{commits}-g{hash}[-dirty]`
- Example: `v1.0.0-5-g870d65b` = 5 commits after v1.0.0 tag

The GitHub install endpoints (`POST /update/github`, `POST /update`) and the MQTT install command likewise have no authentication and rely on network/broker security. The GitHub image download is transport-encrypted (HTTPS, validated against the certificate bundle) but the image itself is not signature-verified unless Secure Boot / signed OTA is enabled.
